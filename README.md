## Frontend Assessment

- Word Scrambler - hatchways app two
- I tried several routes to implement the autofocus and it did not succeed ... to change the input you have to use the tab key. the other requirements were implemented without problems. A thousand apologies ... I decided to send it so many days passed and in a real environment it may not be viable.
This time I didn't use redux and I also used the atomic design concept to create reusable components.
